# CameraTest
Instructions:
1) Download the project and open in Android Studio
2) Connect any Phone and Click run button on the Android Studio to install in the phone

Further Considerations:
1) To securely store photos we can store it in internal storage of the app, this will prevent external apps from accessing the data.
2) We can also add layers of encryption to make it more secure.
3) The app right now captures 1 image from front camera and saves it.
